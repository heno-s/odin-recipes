        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish
            which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese,
            in between the lasagna noodles.

            <li>cooking spray</li>

            <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed</li>

            <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>

            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>

            <li>3 cups marinara sauce, divided</li>

            <li>2 (22 ounce) packages frozen cheese ravioli</li>

            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>

            <br />

            <li>
                Squeeze thawed spinach between several layers of paper towels to remove as much excess moisture as possible.
                Transfer spinach to a medium bowl and stir in ricotta cheese, egg, salt, pepper, and garlic powder until well
                combined.
            </li>

            <br />

            <li>
                Pour 1 cup marinara sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange 1/2 of the ravioli in a single layer
                over the sauce. Pour 1 cup sauce over the ravioli, then spread ricotta mixture over the sauce and top with 1/2 cup
                mozzarella cheese. Top with remaining ravioli, remaining sauce, and remaining mozzarella.
            </li>

            <br />

            <li>Cover with parchment paper and then cover tightly with foil. Freeze for up to one month.</li>

            <br />

            <li>When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

            <br />

            <li>
                Place frozen covered lasagna in the preheated oven and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Uncover and bake until golden and
                bubbly, about 20 more minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
